Sorry that it's a bare minimum app of my original idea. I got busy with some personal thhings so couldn't do everything.
The idea is to connect blood doners with ones who need it, as blood is a crucial part of our life.

Currently I mainly see facbook groups for this need. This app is supposed to be dedicated platform for blood.

Thank you so much! 
I had fun!
